*   The codes are written in **Python** and the platform that has been used in **Google Colab**.
*   In order **to run the submitted code**, create a folder named EOHC_DC in your Google Drive and upload the dataset file in that folder since the code retrieves the files from Google Drive.
*   Each of the code files is divided into **blocks of cells for easy code readability**. Each cell performs some appropriate job explained by comments and necessary headings.
*   As instructed in the problem statement, all the programs are written in a single file following a **modular approach** and it is ensured that the **main function** of the program runs all the steps in sequence as asked in the assignment.
*   Details of the results, observations and interpretation can be found in the **report** attached along with the submission. The clustering information obtained using each method are saved in text files and are attached in the submission in the **Clustering Information Text Files** folder.
*   The clustering information using the optimal value of number of clusters for both KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering can be found in **Experimental Outcomes** folder.
*   It takes **approximately 30 seconds** for the entire code to run all the steps in a reasonable PC configuration.
*   **The optimal value of k is found to be 5 using Silhouette Coefficient as the evaluation metric**. Using this value, **Complete Linkage Divisive Clustering** is performed and the **Jaccard Similarity** values for corresponding clusters are calculated which turned to be quite impressive.
*   **As instructed in the Problem Statement**, all the parts and subparts are done carefully and results and conclusions are put in the report.
